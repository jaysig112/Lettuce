                This "text-input" thing is an angular "directive"

                You can create directives to wrap a piece of html and also add some functionality
                To me, its almost like having Objects in HTML.

                You can find the definition of the TextInput directive in the directives/text-input folder

                You can use this, or just use regular input tags. The benefit of this is that it will already
                be styled for you, and you just pass it the model, the label, and a model for error and success.
                
                If the error variable is null, there wont be anything. But, if you make it a string, the text box
                will be bordered red, get a little X, and have your string shown in a popover when you mouse over 
                the input box.

                Thats why i captured that functionality into a directive. If you have a field that is going to be a
                text input, you can use this and it will have those things automagically! Theoretically, you dont
                even need to think about it, you just give it a model and voila!

                <text-input model="team.name" label="Team Name" error="validationErrors.name"
                success="validationSuccess.name"></text-input>
                <button class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="createTeam()">Create</button>
